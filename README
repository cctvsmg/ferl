You spot a pack of ferl ferrets roaming the woods.



ferl is the embryo of an automated trading system written in Erlang. No world domination, no fame, no glory, just code. The project will be a continuous evolution, one commit at a time.

The name is pronounced fe*ral [feer-uhl, fer-] as in feral.  Why? because this will be wild (* growl *).

The plan right now is to use: 
- Erlang
- CouchDB 
- Maybe some RabbitMQ
* List is subject to change at anytime


The features I'll be focusing on first are something like:
- Simple indicators
- Paper trading
- Back testing
- A couple data feeds
